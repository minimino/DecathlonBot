# DecathlonBot
Checks periodically if a item in Decathlon has stock, and sends a mesasage through Telegram if successful. Written entirely with Python.

# Why

During the COVID-19 pandemic I wanted to buy cheap weightlifting training plates at Decathlon, but there was no stock. I knew that every few days they would restock these items, so I created a bot that checked for stock every minute or so, and sent me a Telegram message if the products were available.
